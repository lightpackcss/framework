# Lightpack CSS Framework

No compilers. No fuss. Just Native CSS + JavaScript components that work â€” from themes to tabs, toasts, drawers & more.

[lightpackcss/framework](https://github.com/lightpackcss/framework) 

This project is a modern, modular CSS framework with zero build dependencies for consumers. Use the CSS and JS directly in the browser, or integrate with your build pipeline.

## Features

- Modular, customizable, themeable CSS architecture
- Native, dependency-free JavaScript components (tabs, accordions, alerts, modals, drawers, toasts, theme switcher, etc.)
- Easy to use: just include the built CSS/JS or import into your project
- Designed for extensibility and theming
